I was assigned a bug and after some investigations I was still quite perplexed. It was not a surprise at all since I was not familiar with the code base and the product services of the company. However, the most unfortunate thing was that my mentor was on PTO. So I decided to slack a senior software engineer on the other team who is in charged of the service I was working on to get more code context of the code architecture. When my mouse hovered over his name, a link poppep up <a href=\"https://www.nohello.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">www.nohello.com</a>. After reading it, I feel like it’s a really interesting topic that I’ve never thought about.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Hey Kevin, you there?</em></li>\n<li><em>Hello Kevin, do you have time right now?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>People tend to be polite when starting a conversation with just <strong>Hi</strong> or <strong>Hello</strong>. It’s great when it’s a conversation in person. However, if you stop there in a text chat, I have no idea what you want to talk with me about when I see your hello. And then I’ll have to wait for you to phrase your question or request. This is just not efficient.</p>\n<p>The following two lines are pretty much my go-to now.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi Kevin, quick question. Do you know …?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello Kevin, when you have time can you …?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let other people know your purpose before getting a reply allows asynchronous communication and increases productivity. This doesn’t only apply to work-related conversations but also some conversations with friends and family. For instance, asking my sister to buy me dinner on her way home or asking a friend to a movie. You will probably save a couple of minutes on each conversation. It might not seems like a lot but it adds up!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/the-no-hello-rule","tagSlugs":["/tag/thoughts/"],"langKey":"en"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-08-17","description":"Don't just say hello in chat!","tags":["Thoughts"],"title":"The No Hello Rule","socialImage":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/the-no-hello-rule","translations":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["3016035026","3475168723","4282317205"]}
