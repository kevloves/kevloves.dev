I can still recall it was like just a couple of days after I started my new job. I was assigned a bug. After some investigations, I was still quite perplexed. It was not a surprise at all since I was not familiar with the codebase and the product services of the company. However, the most unfortunate thing was that my mentor was on PTO. So I decided to slack a senior software engineer on the other team who is in charge of the service I was working on to get more code context of the code architecture. When my mouse hovered over his name, a link popped up [www.nohello.com](https://www.nohello.com/). After reading it, I feel like it's a really interesting topic that I've never thought about.

- _Hey Kevin, you there?_
- _Hello Kevin, do you have time right now?_

People tend to be polite when starting a conversation with just __Hi__ or __Hello__. It's great when it's a conversation in person. However, if you stop there in a text chat, I have no idea what you want to talk with me about when I see your hello. And then I'll have to wait for you to phrase your question or request. This is just not efficient.

The following two lines are pretty much my go-to now.
> Hi Kevin, quick question. Do you know ...?

> Hello Kevin, when you have time can you ...?

Let other people know your purpose before getting a reply allows asynchronous communication and increases productivity. This doesn't only apply to work-related conversations but also some conversations with friends and family. For instance, asking my sister to buy me dinner on her way home or asking a friend to a movie. You will probably save a couple of minutes on each conversation. It might not seem like a lot but it adds up!
