After I decided to create this site, I immediately realize that I probably will have to figure out what to write. Especailly with all the social media accounts I have, it will be great if I can somehow distiguish the usage of here with them. As of right now, I have totally different behaviors on those social media platforms.
### Facebook
I pretty much just lurk around, don't really post anything nowadays, and sometimes share other people's posts.
### Instagram
My personal favorite. It is the main platform that I use to share my personal life and interact with my friends on a daily basis.
### Twitter
I use Twitter to mainly follow the topic/people that I care. Twitter usually has the fastest speed when it comes to gathering information.

Moving forward, I plan to share 

- Tech/ Code
- Investment-related topics
- Thoughts after reading
- Leanring notes (Guitar/ Japanese)
