I'm a software engineer at [__Bitglass__](https://www.bitglass.com/).

I care about web development technologies, code optimization, and keep the code learning process fun. __Python__ and __JavaScript__ are my loves. Really into [__React__](https://reactjs.org/).

I love the building web things, and writing code for fun. Besides coding and technologies, I enjoy music, movie, reading, and playing video games.

When I think of myself, I don't really consider myself a really good writer so I tended to avoid writing in the past. However, during this chaotic 2020, I start to think that I should probably document my life more, or at least write some thoughts down. Thus, this site is created.

I have two cute roommates, follow them on Instagram at [here](https://www.instagram.com/beicha_latte/)!
