Hi, my name is Kevin. I'm a software engineer at [__Bitglass__](https://www.bitglass.com/).

I care about web development technologies, code optimization, and keep the code learning process fun. __Python__ and __JavaScript__ are my loves. Really into [__React__](https://reactjs.org/). I love building web things, and writing code for fun.

I graduated from National Taiwan University in 2016 with a Bachelor's in Biology and continued my studies at the University of California, Davis, where I received a Master's in Computer Science in 2019.

Besides coding and technologies, I also enjoy listening to music, playing video games, and reading a lot. 

When I think of myself, I rarely consider myself a good writer so I tended to avoid writing in the past. However, during this chaotic 2020, I start to think that I should probably document my life more, or at least write some thoughts down. Thus, this site is created.

I have two cute roommates, follow them on Instagram at [here](https://www.instagram.com/beicha_latte/)!
